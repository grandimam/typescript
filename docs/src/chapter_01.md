# Types, Values, and Variables

Javascript types are of two types - primitive and object. The primitive types include - number, string, boolean. There are also two special primitive values null and undefined. All other values other than primitive ones are objects. An object is a collection of properties where each property has a name and a value. 

## Object Types

In addition to basic objects, there are array, map, and set. Functions and Classes are also objects that can be manipulated. JS object types are mutable and its primitive types are immutable.
